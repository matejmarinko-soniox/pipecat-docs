title: "Interruption Strategies"
description: "Configure when users can interrupt the bot to prevent unwanted interruptions from brief affirmations"
---

## Overview

Interruption strategies allow you to control when users can interrupt the bot during speech. By default, any user speech immediately interrupts the bot, but this can be problematic when users make brief affirmations like "yeah", "okay", or "mm-hmm" while listening.

With interruption strategies, you can require users to speak a minimum number of words before their speech will interrupt the bot, creating a more natural conversation flow.

</Tip>

## Configuration

Interruption strategies are configured via the `interruption_strategies` parameter in `PipelineParams`. When specified, the normal immediate interruption behavior is replaced with conditional interruption based on your criteria.

<ParamField
  path="interruption_strategies"
  type="Optional[Sequence[InterruptionStrategy]]"
  default="None"
>
  List of interruption strategies to apply. When multiple strategies are
  provided, they use OR logic (any strategy can trigger interruption). If not
  specified, normal interruption behavior applies.
</ParamField>

## Available Strategies

### MinWordsInterruptionStrategy

Requires users to speak a minimum number of words before interrupting the bot.

<ParamField path="min_words" type="int" required>
  Minimum number of words the user must speak to interrupt the bot. Must be
  greater than 0.
</ParamField>

## How It Works

When interruption strategies are configured:

1. **Bot not speaking**: User speech interrupts immediately (normal behavior)
2. **Bot speaking**: User speech is aggregated and evaluated against strategies
3. **Conditions met**: Bot is interrupted and user speech is processed
4. **Conditions not met**: User speech is discarded

## Usage Examples

### Basic Word Count Interruption

Require users to speak at least 3 words to interrupt the bot:

```python
from pipecat.frames.frames import MinWordsInterruptionStrategy
from pipecat.pipeline.task import PipelineParams, PipelineTask

task = PipelineTask(
    pipeline,
    params=PipelineParams(
        allow_interruptions=True,
        interruption_strategies=[MinWordsInterruptionStrategy(min_words=3)]
    )
)
```

## Behavior Comparison

| Scenario                                      | Without Strategy          | With MinWordsInterruptionStrategy(min_words=3) |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| User says "okay" while bot speaks             | ✅ Interrupts immediately | ❌ Ignored (only 1 word)                       |
| User says "yes that's right" while bot speaks | ✅ Interrupts immediately | ✅ Interrupts (3 words)                        |
| User speaks while bot is silent               | ✅ Processed immediately  | ✅ Processed immediately                       |

## Notes

- Interruption strategies only affect behavior when the bot is actively speaking
- When the bot is not speaking, user input is processed immediately regardless of strategy configuration
- The `allow_interruptions` parameter must be `True` for interruption strategies to work
- User speech that doesn't meet interruption criteria is discarded, not queued
- Multiple strategies use OR logic - any strategy can trigger an interruption
- Word counting uses simple whitespace splitting for word boundaries
