title: "Pipeline Idle Detection"
description: "Automatically detect and handle idle pipelines with no bot activity"
---

## Overview

Pipeline idle detection is a feature that monitors activity in your pipeline and can automatically cancel tasks when no meaningful bot interactions are occurring. This helps prevent pipelines from running indefinitely when a conversation has naturally ended but wasn't properly terminated.

## How It Works

The system monitors specific "activity frames" that indicate the bot is actively engaged in the conversation. By default, these are:

- `BotSpeakingFrame` - When the bot is speaking
- `LLMFullResponseEndFrame` - When the LLM has completed a response

If no activity frames are detected within the configured timeout period (5 minutes by default), the system considers the pipeline idle and can automatically terminate it.

<Note>
  Idle detection only starts after the pipeline has begun processing frames. The
  idle timer resets whenever an activity frame (as specified in
  `idle_timeout_frames`) is received.
</Note>

## Configuration

You can configure idle detection behavior when creating a `PipelineTask`:

```python
from pipecat.pipeline.task import PipelineParams, PipelineTask

# Default configuration - cancel after 5 minutes of inactivity
task = PipelineTask(pipeline)

# Custom configuration
task = PipelineTask(
    pipeline,
    params=PipelineParams(allow_interruptions=True),
    idle_timeout_secs=600,  # 10 minute timeout
    idle_timeout_frames=(BotSpeakingFrame,),  # Only monitor bot speaking
    cancel_on_idle_timeout=False,  # Don't auto-cancel, just notify
)
```

## Configuration Parameters

<ParamField path="idle_timeout_secs" type="Optional[float]" default="300">
  Timeout in seconds before considering the pipeline idle. Set to `None` to
  disable idle detection.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
  path="idle_timeout_frames"
  type="Tuple[Type[Frame], ...]"
  default="(BotSpeakingFrame, LLMFullResponseEndFrame)"
>
  Frame types that should prevent the pipeline from being considered idle.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="cancel_on_idle_timeout" type="bool" default="True">
  Whether to automatically cancel the pipeline task when idle timeout is
  reached.
</ParamField>

## Handling Idle Timeouts

You can respond to idle timeout events by adding an event handler:

```python
@task.event_handler("on_idle_timeout")
async def on_idle_timeout(task):
    logger.info("Pipeline has been idle for too long")
    # Perform any custom cleanup or logging
    # Note: If cancel_on_idle_timeout=True, the pipeline will be cancelled after this handler runs
```

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example showing how to configure idle detection with custom handling:

```python
from pipecat.frames.frames import BotSpeakingFrame, LLMFullResponseEndFrame, TTSSpeakFrame
from pipecat.pipeline.runner import PipelineRunner
from pipecat.pipeline.task import PipelineParams, PipelineTask

# Create pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([...])

# Configure task with custom idle settings
task = PipelineTask(
    pipeline,
    params=PipelineParams(allow_interruptions=True),
    idle_timeout_secs=180,  # 3 minutes
    cancel_on_idle_timeout=False  # Don't auto-cancel
)

# Add event handler for idle timeout
@task.event_handler("on_idle_timeout")
async def on_idle_timeout(task):
    logger.info("Conversation has been idle for 3 minutes")

    # Add a farewell message
    await task.queue_frame(TTSSpeakFrame("I haven't heard from you in a while. Goodbye!"))

    # Then end the conversation gracefully
    await task.stop_when_done()

runner = PipelineRunner()

await runner.run(task)
```
