The `TranscriptionLogObserver` logs all speech-to-text transcription activity in your Pipecat pipeline, providing visibility into both final and interim transcription results.

## Frame Types Monitored

The observer tracks the following frame types (only from STT service):

- **TranscriptionFrame**: Final transcription results
- **InterimTranscriptionFrame**: In-progress transcription results

## Usage

```python
from pipecat.observers.loggers.transcription_log_observer import TranscriptionLogObserver

task = PipelineTask(
    pipeline,
    params=PipelineParams(
        observers=[TranscriptionLogObserver()],
    ),
)
```

## Log Output Format

The observer uses consistent formatting with emoji indicators:

- ðŸ’¬ [Source] â†’ TRANSCRIPTION: [text] from [user_id]
- ðŸ’¬ [Source] â†’ INTERIM TRANSCRIPTION: [text] from [user_id]

All log entries include timestamps for precise timing analysis.
