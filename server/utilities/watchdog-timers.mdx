## Overview

Watchdog timers are used to detect if a Pipecat task is taking longer than expected. By default, if watchdog timers are enabled and a task takes longer than 5 seconds to reset the timer, a warning will be logged. Watchdog timers are very common in real-time applications to detect if things are frozen or taking too much time. Usually, you start the watchdog and you need to keep resetting it before the watchdog timer timeout expires.

In Pipecat, watchdog timers are available if you create a task using the `FrameProcessor.create_task()` method. If you use `asyncio.create_task()` or `loop.create_task()`, watchdog timers will not work.

## Configuration

Watchdog timers are disabled by default. You can enable and configure them using the following `PipelineTask` constructor arguments:

<ParamField
  path="watchdog_timeout_secs"
  type="float"
  default="5.0"
>
  Watchdog timer timeout.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
  path="enable_watchdog_logging"
  type="bool"
  default="False"
>
  Whether to print task processing times.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
  path="enable_watchdog_timers"
  type="bool"
  default="False"
>
  Whether to enable watchdog timers.
</ParamField>

It is possible to configure watchdog timers individually for each `FrameProcessor`, using the same argument names in the constructor, or even per task when creating them with `FrameProcessor.create_task()`.

## How It Works

Watchdog timers are always available for every created Pipecat task:

1. We enable watchdog timers using `enable_watchdog_timers`.
2. A task is created with `FrameProcessor.create_task()` and its watchdog timer is started.
3. The task needs to periodically call `self.reset_watchdog()` to prevent the watchdog timer to expire
4. If the watchdog timer is not reset a warning will be logged

## Usage Examples

```python
class MyFrameProcessor(FrameProcessor):

    async def process_frame(self, frame: Frame, direction: FrameDirection):
        await super().process_frame(frame, direction)
        ...
        self._task = self.create_task(self._task_handler())
        ...

    async def _task_handler(self):
        while True:
            item = await self._queue.get()

            ...
            # Perform any processing
            ...
            self.reset_watchdog()
```

## Notes

- Watchdog timers are disabled by default
- Watchdog timers only work with Pipecat tasks (use `FrameProcessor.create_task()`)
- Watchdog timers can be enabled and configure globally with `PipelineTask`, per `FrameProcessor` or per task
